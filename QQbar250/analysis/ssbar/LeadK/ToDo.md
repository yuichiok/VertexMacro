# SSbar Analysis Notes

General and technical progress report will be noted here.\
Not meant to be disclosed to the public!

## 04/30/2021

We are interested in Leading K > 10 GeV momentum.

#### List of Tasks
 - [x] Which leading K coming from which particles? (mother PID of LeadK)
 	- [x] Can we add getParents from MC Lead K ?
 	- [x] Trace parents until pdg says u/d/s. Loop until it hits those pdg numbers.
 - [ ] K angle closer to each other?

## 05/05/2021

Parents of MC and Reco is complete. Yet direct parents were mostly Z boson or K itself. 

## 05/10/2021

Parents of MC is now tracked until ffbar pair.
Next steps to be done.

#### List of Tasks
 - [x] Leading Kaon multiplicity in a jet and in an event.
 - [ ] Leading Kaon momentum of those from ssbar and uubar.
 - [ ] Leading Kaon polar angle.
